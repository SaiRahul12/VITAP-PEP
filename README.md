**Project: AI Proctored Exam Platform for VIT-AP University**

**Description:**
I took the initiative to design and develop an innovative AI proctored exam platform for VIT-AP University, leveraging ReactJS for the frontend. This project aimed to enhance the university's assessment process by incorporating AI-based proctoring and automated programming question evaluation.

**Key Contributions:**
- **AI Proctoring Implementation:** Integrated advanced AI proctoring technology into the exam platform to ensure a secure and fair examination environment. The AI proctoring system monitored students' activities during exams, such as facial recognition, eye tracking, and activity detection, to detect any suspicious behavior.

- **Automated Programming Evaluation:** Implemented an automated programming evaluation system using ReactJS and backend technologies to automatically assess and grade students' programming assignments. This not only reduced the manual effort required for evaluation but also provided quick and accurate feedback to students.

- **User-Friendly Frontend:** Designed and developed the frontend using ReactJS to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for students and faculty members. The platform offered a seamless and interactive experience for users, making it easy to navigate and use during exams.

- **Collaborative Development:** Worked closely with a team of developers, testers, and stakeholders to gather requirements, plan project milestones, and ensure timely delivery. Effectively collaborated with backend developers to integrate the frontend with the backend functionalities.

- **Performance Optimization:** Implemented performance optimization techniques to enhance the platform's responsiveness and reduce loading times, ensuring smooth user experience even during peak usage.

**Outcome:**
The AI proctored exam platform received positive feedback from the university faculty and students. It significantly improved the integrity of the examination process, minimized cheating incidents, and provided more efficient evaluation of programming assignments. The platform's user-friendly design contributed to high user adoption rates and improved overall satisfaction.

**Technologies Used:**
- ReactJS (JavaScript library for frontend development)
- AI-based proctoring technologies(CNN)
- Backend technologies (Django,NodeJS)
- Version control system (e.g., Git)
